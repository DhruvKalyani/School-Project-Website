        				<span class="project-2-involves">Project 2 involves recycling paper to produce eco-friendly gift cards embedded with flower seeds, combining creativity with environmental consciousness. The process starts with collecting wastepaper from the printing room, which is then shredded and pulped. This pulp is mixed with water to form a slurry, which is then spread out to form a thick sheets. While the paper is still wet, flower seeds are carefully embedded into it, ensuring they will sprout when the card is planted. After the paper dries and hardens, it is cut into card-sized pieces and designed with messages or artwork. The final step involves testing the cards to confirm that the seeds will germinate successfully. This project not only promotes recycling but also encourages recipients to engage in planting, thus giving new life to the wastepaper.</span>
