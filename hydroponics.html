        				<span class="this-method-addresses">In Project 3, the Kratky hydroponics method is employed to grow cabbage using recycled plastic water bottles and poultry manure as the nutrient source. The project begins with preparing the water bottles, which arecleaned to serve as mini reservoirs for the hydroponic system. Poultry manure is then processed and diluted to create a nutrient-rich solution that will nourish the plants. The cabbage seedlings are placed in directly securing the stem using folded wastepaper, which are suspended in the water bottles, allowing their roots to hang into the nutrient solution. Cabbage seedlings were placed in the system, but unfortunately, they did not survive due to the high concentration of nutrients. Recognizing the issue, the solution was further diluted, and balsam plants were introduced as an alternative. This time, the plants thrived, demonstrating the importance of nutrient balance in hydroponic systems. Over time, the plants grow without soil, sustained entirely by the hydroponic setup.</span>
